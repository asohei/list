		1. new user comes to the site. he will find empty page which accepts list. No login is required.
			- in the back, site identifies his machine ID.
		
		2. the user comes back again. and see what he has done.
			- in the back, site identifies his machine ID and displays his list.
			
		3. if he wants to work from other devices (work PC, mobile, etc), he has to create login to start associate with his account with other device thru login.
